keybattle1-name1,Romelu Lukaku,1st Battle - Player 1's name
keybattle1-name2,Laurent Koscielny,1st Battle - Player 2's name
keybattle1-txt,"Koscielny’s comeback this week is welcomes news for Arsenal, as both Gabriel Paulista and Per Mertesacker have struggled of late. He faces the in-form Lukaku, who has scored five goals in his last four games and whose slaloming solo run led to a magnificent opener against Chelsea.

keybattle2-name2,Francis Coquelin,2nd Battle - Player 2's name
keybattle2-txt,"Coquelin lost his cool in his last league game, the 2-2 draw against Tottenham, and was sent off for a rash tackle.

He has come of age.",2nd Battle text

keybattle3-txt,"Bosnian midfielder Besic came to prominence by marking Lionel Messi in the last World Cup. Now, as he stands in for the banned Gareth Barry, his mission will be to keep Oezil quiet. The German has 18 Premier League assists this season, only two away from Thierry Henry’s record but just two of them have come in 2016.",3rd Battle text
